## Summary of Your Prompts

1. **Initial Request**: You need to create concise rules for an LLM to follow when writing software according to the 12-factor manifesto principles. You provided the full 12-factor documentation from GitHub and wanted:
  - A clear, compact representation of the principles
  - Context helpful for an AI agent implementing applications
  - Rules that could be used for both implementing and checking existing implementations

2. **Second Request**: You asked what automated validation scripts would look like for checking 12-factor compliance.

3. **Third Request**: You wanted to expand the rules document with more explicit examples showing patterns and anti-patterns. Specifically requesting:
  - A section with technology-neutral guidance for each factor
  - Specific example sections for different programming languages
  - Alternative examples where possible for each language

4. **Fourth Request**: You asked to break down the comprehensive guide, starting with Factor I (Codebase) as a standalone document.

## What I've Delivered

1. **12-Factor Rules for LLM Software Development** - A concise guide with DO/DON'T rules, implementation patterns, and validation checklists
2. **Automated Validation Scripts** - Python and Bash scripts for checking 12-factor compliance in codebases
3. **Started a comprehensive patterns guide** - Began creating detailed examples but it became too large
4. **Factor I: Codebase Detailed Guide** - A complete standalone document with technology-neutral guidance and examples in 5 languages (JavaScript/Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, Go)

## Current Status
You now have a complete detailed guide for Factor I. The logical next step would be to create similar standalone documents for Factors II through XII, each with the same level of detail and language-specific examples.
